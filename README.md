# pushshiftreader

A Python module for extracting and analyzing Reddit data from Pushshift archives.

## Features

- **Stream large archives** — Memory-efficient processing of multi-gigabyte .zst files
- **Extract by subreddit** — Pull specific subreddits from the full archive
- **Parallel extraction** — Process multiple months simultaneously with `workers=N` or `--workers -1`
- **Resumable extraction** — Re-run safely; completed months are skipped automatically
- **Keyword/regex filtering** — Filter posts and comments by content at extraction time
- **Author statistics** — Per-author activity counts, scores, and date ranges written to CSV
- **Reconstruct comment trees** — Rebuild threaded conversations with nested replies
- **Signal detection** — Annotate threads with custom boolean signals; ships with built-in detectors for regex, score thresholds, and OP participation
- **DataFrame export** — One-line export to pandas with thread-level features (depth, thread size, response time, submission metadata) joined in; optional signals join
- **Graph export** — Export conversation graphs (comment→reply) and author-interaction graphs (who replies to whom) as node/edge CSV files
- **Multiple output formats** — CSV for easy analysis, compressed JSON for full fidelity
- **Simple API** — Clean Python interface for research workflows

## Installation

```bash
# Clone or download the package
cd pushshiftreader

# Create virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install with progress bars

# Or minimal install
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Extract Subreddit Data

Extract specific subreddits from the monthly Pushshift archives:

```python
from pushshiftreader import SubredditExtractor

extractor = SubredditExtractor(
    archive_path="/path/to/reddit_dumps",  # Contains comments/ and submissions/
    output_path="./extracted",
    subreddits=["AskHistorians", "AskScience"]
)

result = extractor.run()
print(f"Extracted {result.total_comments:,} comments")
```

Or use the command line:

```bash
pushshiftreader extract \
    --archive /path/to/reddit_dumps \
    --output ./extracted \
    --subreddits AskHistorians AskScience
```

### 2. Resume an Interrupted Extraction

If a run is interrupted, just re-run the same command. Any month that already has a
`metadata.json` is skipped automatically — only missing months are processed:

```python
# Safe to re-run; completed months are skipped
result = extractor.run()
```

```bash
# Same command — completed months are skipped
pushshiftreader extract \
    --archive /path/to/reddit_dumps \
    --output ./extracted \
    --subreddits AskHistorians

# Force a full re-extraction, overwriting existing data
pushshiftreader extract ... --force
```

### 3. Speed Up Extraction with Parallel Workers

For large archives, process multiple months at the same time by setting `workers`:

```python
extractor = SubredditExtractor(
    archive_path="/path/to/reddit_dumps",
    output_path="./extracted",
    subreddits=["ChangeMyView"],
    workers=-1,   # use all available CPU cores
)
result = extractor.run()
```

```bash
# Use all CPU cores
pushshiftreader extract \
    --archive /path/to/reddit_dumps \
    --output ./extracted \
    --subreddits ChangeMyView \
    --workers -1

# Or specify an exact count
pushshiftreader extract ... --workers 8
```

Each month is processed in an independent worker process. The sequential code path (the default, `workers=1`) is unchanged — per-file progress bars still work as before. With `workers > 1`, a per-month completion bar is shown instead.

Resumability works normally in parallel mode: already-completed months are detected before any workers are launched and simply skipped.

### 4. Filter by Keyword or Regex

Keep only records whose text matches your patterns. Filters are applied during streaming,
so non-matching records never touch disk.

- **`include_patterns`** — record must match at least one pattern to be kept
- **`exclude_patterns`** — record is dropped if it matches any pattern
- Searches `title` + `selftext` for submissions; `body` for comments
- All patterns are case-insensitive regular expressions

```python
extractor = SubredditExtractor(
    archive_path="/path/to/reddit_dumps",
    output_path="./extracted",
    subreddits=["science"],
    include_patterns=["climate change", "global warming", r"\bCO2\b"],
    exclude_patterns=[r"\[deleted\]", "off.topic"],
)
result = extractor.run()
```

```bash
pushshiftreader extract \
    --archive /path/to/reddit_dumps \
    --output ./extracted \
    --subreddits science \
    --include "climate change" "global warming" \
    --exclude "\[deleted\]"
```

The patterns used are recorded in every `metadata.json` file for reproducibility.

### 5. Author Statistics

After each extraction, `authors.csv` files are written automatically — no extra steps needed.

**Per-month** (`<subreddit>/<YYYY-MM>/authors.csv`):

| column | description |
|---|---|
| `author` | Reddit username |
| `comment_count` | Comments in that month |
| `submission_count` | Submissions in that month |
| `comment_score_total` | Sum of comment scores |
| `avg_comment_score` | Average comment score |
| `submission_score_total` | Sum of submission scores |
| `avg_submission_score` | Average submission score |
| `first_seen_utc` | Earliest activity timestamp |
| `last_seen_utc` | Latest activity timestamp |

**Subreddit-level** (`<subreddit>/authors.csv`) — aggregated across all extracted months,
including those from previous runs:

Same columns as above, plus `months_active` (number of distinct months with activity).

### 6. Build Comment Trees

Reconstruct threaded conversations:

```python
from pushshiftreader import TreeBuilder

builder = TreeBuilder("./extracted/AskHistorians")
builder.build_all_months()
```

Command line:

```bash
pushshiftreader build-trees ./extracted/AskHistorians
```

### 7. Detect Signals

After building trees, run custom detectors over thread data to produce a
`signals.csv` per month.  Each detector adds one boolean column; only rows
where at least one signal fires are written (sparse output, easy to join with
`comments.csv`).

**Subclass `Detector` to define your own signal:**

```python
from pushshiftreader import SignalDetector, Detector, RegexDetector, AuthorIsOPDetector

class DeltaDetector(Detector):
    """Fires when a comment contains a delta award (CMV convention)."""
    def detect_comment(self, comment, thread):
        return 'Δ' in comment.body or '!delta' in comment.body.lower()

class VerdictDetector(Detector):
    """Fires when a top-level comment contains an AITA verdict token."""
    import re
    _VERDICTS = re.compile(r'\b(NTA|YTA|ESH|NAH|INFO)\b')

    def detect_comment(self, comment, thread):
        return bool(self._VERDICTS.search(comment.body)) and comment.is_top_level

sd = SignalDetector(
    "./extracted/ChangeMyView",
    detectors=[
        DeltaDetector("delta_awarded"),
        AuthorIsOPDetector("op_comment"),
        RegexDetector("cites_source", r"https?://"),
    ],
)
results = sd.run_all_months()
# writes extracted/ChangeMyView/YYYY-MM/signals.csv for each month
```

**Built-in detectors:**

| Class | Description |
|---|---|
| `RegexDetector(name, pattern, record_type, fields)` | Fires if any text field matches the regex |
| `ScoreDetector(name, min_score, max_score, record_type)` | Fires if score is within the given bounds |
| `AuthorIsOPDetector(name)` | Fires if the commenter is the submission's OP |

**`signals.csv` format** (one row per record where at least one signal fired):

| column | description |
|---|---|
| `record_id` | Comment or submission ID |
| `record_type` | `"comment"` or `"submission"` |
| `<signal_name>` | One boolean column per detector |

Join with `comments.csv` on `record_id`; a missing row means all signals are `False`.

### 8. Export to pandas DataFrame

After building trees, export comments or submissions to a pandas DataFrame
with thread-level features automatically joined in.

```python
from pushshiftreader import load_subreddit

data = load_subreddit("./extracted/ChangeMyView")

# All comments across all months — with depth, thread size, response time,
# and submission metadata joined in per row.
# If signals.csv exists for a month it is joined in automatically.
df = data.comments_dataframe()

# Single month
df = data.comments_dataframe("2019-06")

# Submissions DataFrame
subs = data.submissions_dataframe()

# Skip signals join
df = data.comments_dataframe(signals=False)
```

**Columns added on top of standard comment fields:**

| column | description |
|---|---|
| `month` | Source month (``YYYY-MM``) |
| `depth` | Depth in reply tree (0 = top-level comment) |
| `thread_size` | Total comments in the thread |
| `time_since_submission` | Seconds between submission post time and comment post time |
| `submission_id` | Parent submission ID |
| `submission_title` | Parent submission title |
| `submission_score` | Parent submission score |
| `submission_author` | Parent submission author |
| `<signal_name>` | Boolean signal columns, if ``signals.csv`` exists |

You can also convert a single `Thread` object directly:

```python
for thread in data.threads("2019-06"):
    df = thread.to_dataframe()   # same columns as above, no 'month'
    high_scoring = df[df['score'] > 50]
```

### 9. Export Graphs

Export conversation structure or author-interaction networks as node/edge CSV files,
ready for Gephi, NetworkX, or any graph tool.

**Comment/conversation graph** — nodes are submissions and comments, edges are replies:

```python
from pushshiftreader import load_subreddit

data = load_subreddit("./extracted/ChangeMyView")

# Writes comment_graph_nodes.csv and comment_graph_edges.csv
data.export_comment_graph("./graphs/")

# Single month
data.export_comment_graph("./graphs/", month="2019-06")
```

**Author-interaction graph** — nodes are usernames, edges represent reply relationships:

```python
# Writes author_graph_nodes.csv and author_graph_edges.csv
data.export_author_graph("./graphs/")
```

Both methods also work on individual `Thread` objects (returning lists of dicts rather than writing to disk):

```python
for thread in data.threads("2019-06"):
    nodes, edges = thread.to_comment_graph()
    nodes, edges = thread.to_author_graph()
```

**Output file schemas:**

`comment_graph_nodes.csv`:

| column | description |
|---|---|
| `node_id` | `t3_<id>` for submissions, `t1_<id>` for comments |
| `type` | `submission` or `comment` |
| `author` | Reddit username |
| `score` | Net upvotes |
| `created_utc` | Unix timestamp |
| `depth` | 0 = submission root, 1 = top-level reply, etc. |

`comment_graph_edges.csv`:

| column | description |
|---|---|
| `source` | Parent node ID |
| `target` | Child node ID |
| `time_delta` | Seconds from parent post time to child post time |

`author_graph_nodes.csv`:

| column | description |
|---|---|
| `author` | Reddit username |
| `comment_count` | Total comments in the dataset |
| `total_score` | Sum of comment scores |
| `first_seen_utc` / `last_seen_utc` | Activity window |

`author_graph_edges.csv`:

| column | description |
|---|---|
| `source` | Replying author |
| `target` | Author being replied to |
| `weight` | Number of times source replied to target |
| `first_interaction_utc` | Timestamp of first interaction |

### 10. Load and Analyze

```python
from pushshiftreader import load_subreddit

data = load_subreddit("./extracted/AskHistorians")

# See what's available
print(f"Months: {data.months}")
print(f"Total submissions: {data.metadata.total_submissions:,}")

# Iterate over submissions
for submission in data.submissions("2023-01"):
    print(f"{submission.created_datetime}: {submission.title}")

# Iterate over comments
for comment in data.comments("2023-01"):
    if comment.score > 100:
        print(f"{comment.author}: {comment.body[:100]}...")

# Work with threaded data
for thread in data.threads("2023-01"):
    print(f"\n{thread.submission.title}")
    print(f"  {thread.comment_count} comments")

    # Walk the comment tree
    for comment, depth in thread.walk():
        indent = "  " * (depth + 1)
        print(f"{indent}{comment.author}: {comment.body[:50]}...")
```

## Archive Structure

The extractor expects Pushshift archives organized as:

```
reddit_dumps/
├── comments/
│   ├── RC_2005-12.zst
│   ├── RC_2006-01.zst
│   └── ...
└── submissions/
    ├── RS_2005-12.zst
    ├── RS_2006-01.zst
    └── ...
```

## Output Structure

Extracted data is organized by subreddit and month:

```
extracted/
└── AskHistorians/
    ├── metadata.json           # Subreddit-level stats (aggregated from all months)
    ├── authors.csv             # Per-author stats aggregated across all months
    ├── 2023-01/
    │   ├── metadata.json       # Month stats + patterns used
    │   ├── authors.csv         # Per-author stats for this month
    │   ├── submissions.csv     # Flat CSV
    │   ├── submissions.jsonl.gz # Compressed JSON lines
    │   ├── comments.csv
    │   ├── comments.jsonl.gz
    │   └── threads.jsonl.gz    # Nested thread structures (after build-trees)
    ├── 2023-02/
    │   └── ...
    └── ...
```

### Core Classes

#### `SubredditExtractor`

Extracts subreddit data from Pushshift archives.

```python
extractor = SubredditExtractor(
    archive_path: Path,                    # Root archive directory
    output_path: Path,                     # Where to write extracted data
    subreddits: List[str],                 # Subreddits to extract
    output_format: str = "both",           # "csv", "jsonl", or "both"
    show_progress: bool = True,
    include_patterns: List[str] = None,    # Keep records matching any pattern
    exclude_patterns: List[str] = None,    # Drop records matching any pattern
    force: bool = False,                   # Re-extract already-completed months
    workers: int = 1,                      # Parallel worker processes (-1 = all cores)
)

result = extractor.run(
    start_month: str = None,  # Optional "YYYY-MM" filter
    end_month: str = None
)
```

#### `TreeBuilder`

Reconstructs comment trees from extracted data.

```python
builder = TreeBuilder(
    extracted_path: Path,     # Path to extracted subreddit
    db_path: Path = None      # SQLite index location (default: in-memory)
)

builder.build_month("2023-01")  # Build specific month
builder.build_all_months()       # Build all months
```

#### `SignalDetector`

Runs detectors over thread data and writes `signals.csv`.

```python
sd = SignalDetector(
    extracted_path: Path,          # Path to extracted subreddit directory
    detectors: List[Detector],     # One or more Detector instances (names must be unique)
)

sd.run_month("2023-01")            # Detect signals for one month
sd.run_all_months()                # Detect signals for all months with threads
```

#### `Detector`

Abstract base class for custom signals.  Override either or both methods:

```python
class MyDetector(Detector):
    def detect_comment(self, comment: Comment, thread: Thread) -> bool: ...
    def detect_submission(self, submission: Submission, thread: Thread) -> bool: ...
```

#### `SubredditData`

Interface for accessing extracted data.

```python
data = load_subreddit("./extracted/AskHistorians")

data.months                                  # List of available months
data.submissions(month=None)                 # Iterator over submissions
data.comments(month=None)                    # Iterator over comments
data.threads(month=None)                     # Iterator over threads
data.get_submission(id)                      # Find specific submission
data.get_thread(id)                          # Find specific thread
data.comments_dataframe(month, signals)      # pandas DataFrame of comments
data.submissions_dataframe(month, signals)   # pandas DataFrame of submissions
data.export_comment_graph(output_dir, month) # write conversation graph CSVs

```

## Tips for Large Archives

1. **Use parallel workers** — `--workers -1` saturates all CPU cores; the bottleneck for large archives is .zst decompression, which scales well across months
2. **Extract to SSD** — Tree building does heavy random access
3. **Process in batches** — Use `--start-month` and `--end-month` to chunk work
4. **Resume freely** — Completed months are always skipped; no need to track progress manually
5. **Monitor disk space** — Extracted data is ~7x larger than compressed
6. **Use JSONL format** — If you only need Python access, skip CSV with `--format jsonl`
7. **Filter early** — Use `--include`/`--exclude` to reduce output size when studying a specific topic
